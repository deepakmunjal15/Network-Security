A program to encrypt and decrypt strings of characters using the following ciphers:
a) Caesar cipher
b) Vigenere cipher
c) Matrix transposition cipher
The program contains functions/methods to encrypt a given plaintext string of characters and a key and generate the corresponding ciphertext. It also contains functions/methods to decrypt a ciphertext string of characters and generate the corresponding plaintext.




A program that will take a message m (an integer) and key (e,n) – two integers, and generate the ciphertext c (another integer), using the RSA algorithm.
